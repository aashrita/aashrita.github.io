# CS267 Intro & HMWK 0

Hi! I'm Aashrita Mangu, a current PhD candidate in the physics department. I graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Caltech. My research interests include precision cosmology, specifically developing detectors for mapping the Cosmic Microwave Background. My current research lab works on POLARBEAR and the Simons Array, detectors located in the Atacama Desert in Chile.

I'd really like to learn more about parallel computing so that I can more effectively use computers for my research. I'm interested in learning about techniques and tools that can help me use, manipulate, and extract useful data.
